      <h1>Myself</h1>
      <p>I'm from a middle family of Enugu state of Nigeria. My name is egbo Chidera. Online I am known as Chris, but people around me know me has Chidera.  Nobody comes in this world, without the support of family and friends. Actually whatever you will be, it is just because of your family. My father is a respectable businessman in our community. My mother is also into business. They both love their occupation. I have learnt from my parents the value of time, honesty, hardwork and commitments to the purpose.</p>
      <p>
We are a family of four boys and a girl. Being the second I am liable to my brothers and sisters. I am expected to assist my older brother to guide and take care of my other siblings.</p>
      <h2>My Education</h2>
      <p>I'm currently through with my senior secondary school and i've written my final exams. I am in University of Nigeria aspirant, hoping to be a student of that great institution of learning soon. Since I'm home now, I just learn some skills online through the help of an online site called "coursera". They have been a great inspiration, as they offer courses like data science, programming, digital marketing and so many others for free and some are paid for.</p>
      <h2>My strengths</h2>
      <p>
Compare two studies, I'm good at sports. I'm a fast runner and I also love athletics. I'm also an expert in long jump. The advice of my parents had keen effect on my habits. I believe to speak the truth and try my best not to lie. My parents also taught me to admit my mistakes not just to myself but also to my offender. I also know how to remain happy in every condition because I believe that: "happiness is not out there; it's in you".
        <p>I am a very adventurous person to and like to take the risk. I like to do creative things beside doing old stuff again and again. Learning new things is one thing which I always enjoy. I always update myself with the news. Along with this I am an omnivert, on seeing a new person I'd exhibit the characteristic of an introvert at first, then later an extrovert. I have a larger percentage of the introverts characteristics than the extroverts which helps me show a right attitude to work.</p>
      <h2>My weakness</h2>
      <p>Does every man have a weakness, so have I also. I am a little bit lazy at some places which I do not like. I'm always shy when it comes to facing a crowd I have not faced before. I spend a lot of time playing video games during my free times which is not a good habit, but I try my best to overcome my weaknesses.</p>
      <h2>My ambition in life</h2>
      <p>Everybody has an ambition in life. Aim or ambition is the inner aspiration of Man. No man can do anything in the world without aim. So all of us should be very determined about our aim in life.</p>
      <p>Without good career planning, right from the start, one can't be on the right track. One has to set the goals in accordance with his or her broad career goals.</p>
      <p>I always wanted to go to India to study medicine, but looking at the financial status of my family I had to drop that dream for now and go for my passion I want to become a computer expert which has led me to taking courses on computer from coursera. I know that I will be a qualified computer expert and I will make sure I am sincere in it.</p>
      <h2>Conclusions</h2>
      <p>These are all the things which expresses me. Though nobody can be described in a few sets of sentence. One needs to have yet command of oneself before going to write something about his life. life is meant to be lived avidly and with visualisation to do good for your fellow beings. keeping this aim in mind, I have always desire to serve and affect people's life in whatever capacity I find myself.<p>
